# accepted-gsoc-proposals

## Contribution guide

NB: 
* Please ensure that shared links are publickly accesible
* Please remove personal information from your proposals if you don't want to share them
* Why Scapping the internet for accepted proposals is good, I will prefer that the GSoC candidates add their proposals themselves(Intellctual property D:)
* To prospective students, this is only a pointer and proposal formats for your organization or mentors could vary, please ask questions to your organization/mentors on how your proposals can be formatted/Structured
