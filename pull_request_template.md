* Create A Folder with name <Organization-name> if your organization is not listed
* Create .md file with name <year-proposals.md> if there is no file for your organization see [here](CiviCRM/2019-proposals.md)
* Add your  GSoC Project Title
* Add accepted GSoC Proposal link with the format `[link](<proposal link>)`
* Add GSoC Project link with the format `[link](<project link>)`

NB: 
* Please ensure that shared links are publickly accesible
* Please remove personal information from your proposals if you don't want to share them
* Why Scapping the internet for accepted proposals is good, I will prefer that the GSoC candidates add their proposals themselves(Intellctual property D:)
